# Gravity Falls Cyphers

![](screencaptures/intro.png)

This is my attempt to solve the already solved cyphers found in each episode the Disney show Gravity Falls.

## Getting Started

### Install the Google Chrome Extension

I'll be watching each episode of [Gravity Falls on Hulu](http://www.hulu.com/gravity-falls). Because of this I've included a [Google Chrome Extension](tools/save-screencapture-from-hulu-video.crx) that when installed will capture and save a PNG of the current frame to your desktop.

## Directory Structure

### cyphers/

Contains the (hopefully) solved cyphers and detailed instructions on how they were solved.

### screencaptures/cyphers/

Contains all of the cyphers found at the end of each episode.

### screencaptures/keys/

Contains all of the (possible) cyphers found throughout each episode.

## Contributing

I'm not taking contributions to this repo as I'd like to solve the cyphers on my own. I encourage anyone that is interested in also solving these cyphers to fork this repo and utilize the tools I've included.
